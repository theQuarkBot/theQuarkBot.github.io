# theQuarkBot.github.io

This is a basic HTML, CSS, and (maybe) JavaScript website that shares stuff about me! For the most part, this will not contain any personally identifying information for the sake of keeping me anonymous for people that were not referred here by me, but will contain some things. As such, I ask that you don't take advantage of what I have done (I am simply trying to build a profile for myself and do not want any sort of trouble).

Thank you!

P.S. The website can be found at thequarkbot.github.io
